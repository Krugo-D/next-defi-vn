Users don’t rely on a centralized group of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons. This decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.

It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and can be the target of transactions. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.
